# Discovering TCR-HLA-Epitope Interactions

`themap-tools` is a package for analysis of `peptide-HLA presentation` and `TCR specificity`. It is designed to help researchers understand the interactions between T cell receptors (TCRs) and peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, which play a crucial role in the immune response.

## 🚀 Key Features of `themap-tools`

- **Peptide representation learning with HLA context**  
  Learns latent embeddings of peptides while incorporating HLA background, enabling biologically informed modeling.

- **TCR specificity prediction using full receptor sequences**  
  Supports comprehensive modeling of TCR recognition by leveraging both α and β chain CDR regions.

- **Visualization of critical TCR residues**  
  Highlights key amino acid positions in TCRs that contribute to antigen recognition, aiding biological interpretation.

- **Discovery of disease-associated epitopes**  
  Identifies novel peptides potentially involved in disease by integrating small-scale disease-specific data with large-scale public datasets.

## 🔧 Components

- `themap.model.HLA_vae` — Variational Autoencoder for HLA sequences  
```python
"""
    Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model for HLA sequences.

    This model learns a latent representation of HLA amino acid sequences
    and reconstructs the original sequence through a decoder. It is trained
    to minimize reconstruction loss and KL divergence.

    Args:
        input_size (list[int]): Shape of input tensor (typically [channels, length]).
        latent_size (int): Dimension of latent representation.
    """
```
- `themap.model.PEP_vae` — Variational Autoencoder for peptide sequences  
- `themap.model.THE` — Main prediction module integrating TCRs with peptide or HLA targets
